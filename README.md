Please set up a Python virtual environment for this project on your personal machine. My (Jason's) machine is currently using Python 3.13.0 as the version. If you need help with installing Python and/or the virtual environment, please let me know!

To run the controller, use `python3 scenario_test.py` in the project directory.
